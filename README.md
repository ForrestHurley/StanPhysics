Experiments with Stan and statistical mechanics simulations. This repository contains the paper and code submitted to StanCon 2019 Cambridge. Compiled forms of the R-Markdown notebook are available as pdf and html (the pdf is recommended as looking slightly nicer). All generated data is in the Results folder.
