abstract: Bayesian statistics is closely coupled with physics. The metropolis algorithm
  (1953) was developed by scientists working at Los Alamos as a method for thermodynamic
  simulation of molecular dynamics. Not until the work of W. K. Hastings (1970) was
  the method generalized to arbitrary probability distributions. Stan is based on yet
  another physically derived sampler (Hamiltonian Monte Carlo). We simulate the XY Model,
  consisting of an N-dimensional grid of unit spins in the XY plane, using Stan. We 
  create chains at several temperatures to identify the locations of phase transitions 
  in macroscopic properties. Our work shows the applicability of Stan for computation in 
  continuous statistical mechanical problems.

# Statistical Mechanics

This section is a short introduction to statistical mechanics summarizing [source].

The first core assumption of statistical mechanics is that the system of interest exists in one of a discrete set of states. These are called microstates to distinguish them from the collections of states which are often of interest, called macrostates. The number of microstates can be countably infinite. In fact, the number of microstates is often assumed to be dense enough to be arbitrarily close to any given state. For example, a free particle can be described using a discrete location, as long as the possible locations are extremely close together. A collection of microstates, often with some defining property, is a macrostate. For example, the collection of microstates with energy 2 is a macrostate. Let $\Omega(E)$ be the number of microstates in the macrostate with energy E. $\Omega(E)$ is also known as the density of states, in a close analogue to probability densities. In fact, the probability of a particular macrostate is proportional to $\Omega(E)$. The normalizing constant is called the partition function; we ignore the partition function and use un-normalized probabilities throughout this work.

![\label{fig:particle}A free particle with location ($\vec{X}$) and momentum ($\vec{P}$).](Images/particle.png){width=3.25in}

In an example system consisting of a single free particle on a plane, there are 4 coordinates: 2 positional coordinates and 2 momentum coordinates. The position does not affect energy, which is given by $E=\frac{|p|^2}{2m}$. Every microstate with energy $E$ must have $|p| \propto E^{1/2}$. The momentum coordinates have a single magnitude, so they must lie in a circle. The size of the macrostate is proportional to the circumference of the circle or $\Omega(E) \propto E^{1/2}$. In higher dimensional space, either corresponding to having more spatial dimensions or to having more particles, this proportionality takes the form $\Omega(E) \propto E^{(D-1)/2}$. Because this proportionality grows exponentially with the number of particles in the system, its logarithm is often used.

## Canonical Distribution

Much of the complexity and usefulness of statistical mechanics appears when systems are not entirely isolated. By taking a large isolated system and splitting it into two interacting subsystems, we have a theoretical framework for studying their properties. The canonical ensemble refers to a partitioning between a system of interest and a much larger heat bath. The only interactions are random exchanges of energy. While the energy of the system as a whole remains constant, the system of interest has constant fluctuations.

![\label{fig:heat_bath}A system in a much larger heat bath. They can freely exchange energy.](Images/heat_bath.png){width=3.25in}

For reasons which can be well justified, but are outside the scope of this paper, we approximate the density of states of the heat bath as $\log( \Omega_{bath}) = \alpha + \beta E_{bath}$. If the density of states of the heat bath is independent of the system of interest then $\Omega_{system}(E_a)=\Omega_{bath}(E_{bath})$. While the densities are usually not truly independent, it is almost always a close approximation. Combining these various assumptions together, we find $p(E_{system}) \propto \Omega_A (E_{system}) \propto e^{-\beta E_{system}}$. $\beta$ is $\frac{1}{kT}$ where T is temperature and k is the Boltzmann constant. For our purposes, we will use units where $k=1$, so $\beta=\frac{1}{T}$. As an example of the correspondance between physical models and statistical ones, consider the canonical ensemble describing a one dimensional space with a single free particle. As previously mentioned $E = \frac{p^2}{2m}$. By substitution we get $P(p) \propto e ^ {-\beta \frac{p^2}{2m}}$. It is simply a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance $m/\beta=mT$.

We wish to use Stan to sample from the canonical ensemble using unnormalized probabilities at a specific temperature ($T=\frac1\beta$). Our uninformative prior is the uniform distribution. In a canonical ensemble the log probability of any state is proportional to $-\beta E$ where $E$ is the energy of the state. We define the likelihood as $p(\beta | E) \sim e^{-\beta E}$; at a fixed temperature we sample states with various energies. The following code calculates this likelihood function.

```{stan output.var="temp",eval=FALSE}
//given the temperature and energy, calculate the likelihood
real canonical_ensemble_lpdf(real temperature, real energy) {
  return -energy / temperature;
}
```

# Physical Model

![\label{fig:1d_ising}A one dimensional Ising Model. Boundaries between up and down spins increase the amount of potential energy.](Images/ising_1d.png){width=3.25in}

One particularly simple statistical mechanical model is the Ising Model. It consists of an N-dimensional lattice of elements which either have spin up or spin down. These elements could be thought of as atoms in a metal; if they are generally aligned there is a net magnetic field. The total energy of the system is the sum of interactions between neighboring elements where $S_i,S_j\in\{-1,1\}$.
$$E=- J\sum_{<i,j>} S_i S_j$$
$J$ is a scalar describing the strength of the interactions and the sum is only over the neighboring spins. If the spins are in the same direction (have the same sign) then the energy is lower. Rather than defining rather arbitrary rules to describe the boundaries of the lattice, it is generally wrapped around such that no boundaries exist. This approach to handling the edges is called a periodic boundary condition. The below image shows such a boundary for a 1 dimensional Ising Model. 

![\label{fig:is_cylinder}A single dimensional Ising Model on a cylinder. Two dimensional models are usually placed on a torus (donut).](Images/ising_cylinder.png){width=3.25in}

The behaviour of the model and difficulty of analysis is very dependent on the number of dimensions of the lattice. In 2 dimensions the Ising Model has two distinct phases. In the ordered phase almost all of the spins are in the same direction. At higher temperatures, in the unordered phase, the spins are random, and the average spin (magnetization) is almost exactly zero. The transition between the two phases occurs suddenly as temperature increases. In fact, the transition happens so suddenly that the derivative of magnetization with respect to temperature has a jump discontinuity. The derivative of the energy with respect to temperature has a similar jump; this is known as a second order phase transition. A first order phase transition would have the jump in energy and magnetization rather than their derivatives.

![As temperature increases beyond a critical threshold, the magnetization of the (2D) Ising Model drops to 0 in a second order phase transition.](Images/ising_transition.png){width=3.25in}

There are a variety of interesting and efficient ways of sampling from the distribution of states of the Ising Model. Because the model is only defined by discrete variables Stan is not one of them [@stan]. While small numbers of discrete parameters can be marginalized out manually, this procedure is complex for the large number of parameters in which we are interested. Due to this limitation we instead focus on the XY Model.

The XY Model is similar to the Ising Model, but with an extra degree of freedom for the spins. The energy of any given state is related to the dot products of the spins of nearest neighbors on the lattice. $$E=-J\sum_{<i,j>}\hat{\sigma}_i\cdot\hat{\sigma}_j$$ Each spin is a unit vector in the XY plane rather than a binary up or down. If these vectors are further constrained to be on the X axis then it is fairly easy to see that the energy equation describes the Ising Model.

![A 2D grid of spins in the 2D plane taken from a simulation of the XY Model](Images/xy_grid.png){width=3.25in}

The Ising Model has a second order phase transition with changing temperature. It also has a first order phase transition as an external magnetic field is applied. However, the XY Model on a 2 dimensional lattice has no first or second order phase transitions. It does however exhibit a  Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. The KT transition relates to the appearance of vortices on the lattice [@Tobochnik1979]. A vortex is a swirling pattern centered on a lattice tile. At the critical temperature $T_{KT}$ vortex pairs unbind and move apart. Previous work has shown that for the XY Model on a 2D lattice, $T_{TK}\approx 0.893$ [@Jensen]. In the remainder of this document we work exclusively with the 2D XY Model. The reader is reminded that the spins being on the XY plane is separate from the dimensionality of the lattice.

```{stan output.var="temp",eval=FALSE}
real xy_energy(vector[,] spins) {
  real energy = 0;
  int spin_dim[4] = dims(spins);

  for (dir in 1:2) {
    //calculate the offset for nearest neighbor calculations
    int dir_x = dir % 2 + spin_dim[1];
    int dir_y = dir / 2 + spin_dim[2];

    for (x in 1:spin_dim[1]) {
      for (y in 1:spin_dim[2]) {
        //calculate the x,y index of the nearest neighbor
        int x_idx = ( (x + dir_x - 1) % spin_dim[1] ) + 1;
        int y_idx = ( (y + dir_y - 1) % spin_dim[2] ) + 1;

        energy += -dot_product( spins[x_idx, y_idx], spins[x, y] );
      }
    }
  }
  
  return energy;
}
```

We implement the spins as 2d vectors constrained to have unit length [@stan_user]. Essentially, our sampling parameters are a multidimensional array of unit vectors. Every iteration we calculate the energy based on nearest neighbor interactions between those spins and set the log likelihood accordingly. The preceding code iterates over every pair of nearest neighbors on the lattice and sums their dot products. It assumes that $J=1$ for simplicity.

## Vorticity

![\label{fig:vort_example}An example configuration of spins on a lattice square. Because the shortest angles between each spin sum to $-2\pi$, it is an anti-vortex.](Images/vorticity_example.png){width=3in}

The KT transition arises from an appearance of large vortices. We identify vortices by looking for lattice cells where the corner spin vectors tend to point clockwise or counterclockwise. Specifically we calculate the shortest difference in angles in the counterclockwise direction and sum. In the figure above, the angle between vectors A and B would be -45 degrees. This sum can either be $2\pi$, $0$, or $-2\pi$ (technically it can also be $4\pi$ and $-4\pi$ but those cases are exceedingly unlikely). On a lattice with periodic boundary conditions, there must be the same number of vortices ($2\pi$) and anti-vortices ($-2\pi$)[@Imriska2009]. As we are only examining periodic lattices, the anti-vortices are not counted or included in any summaries. 

```{r}
crossvec <- function(x,y){
 cv <-  x[1]*y[2]-x[2]*y[1]
 return(invisible(cv))
}

get_coordinates <- function(x,y,dir,spin_dim) {
  dir_x <- ((0 < dir) && (dir < 3)) + spin_dim[1]
  dir_y <- (dir > 1) + spin_dim[2]
  
  x_idx <- ( (x + dir_x - 1) %% spin_dim[1] ) + 1;
  y_idx <- ( (y + dir_y - 1) %% spin_dim[2] ) + 1;

  return(c(x_idx, y_idx))
}

find_angle <- function(spin_array,a, b)
{
  dotted <- crossprod(
    spin_array[a[1],a[2],1:2],spin_array[b[1],b[2],1:2])
  dotted <- pmax(-1, pmin(1, dotted))
  crossed <- crossvec(
    spin_array[a[1],a[2],1:2],spin_array[b[1],b[2],1:2])
  return(acos(dotted) * sign(crossed))
}

vorticity_calc <- function(spin_array) {
  spin_dim = dim(spin_array)[1:2]
  angles = array(0,c(4,spin_dim))
  
  for (x in 1:spin_dim[1]) {
    for (y in 1:spin_dim[2]) {
      
      for (dir in 0:3) {
        a <- get_coordinates(x,y,dir,spin_dim)
        b <- get_coordinates(x,y,(dir + 1) %% 4,spin_dim)
        
        angles[dir+1,x,y] <- find_angle(spin_array,a,b)
      }
    }
  }
  
  around_angles <- apply(angles,c(2,3),sum)
  vortex <- sum(around_angles > 1)
  return(vortex)
}
```

The above code counts vortices by counting the number of lattice squares which have a total rotation of spin vectors greater than 0. Most of the complexity comes from properly calculating the relative angles of vectors and iterating around the edges of the squares.

# Parameters and Iterations

For most experiments we ran 5000 NUTS iterations each on 4 parallel chains with a goal rejection rate of 0.7 and a maximum tree depth of 15. We calculated the density of vortices on 100 random samples from the simulated chains of spin configurations at each temperature. The effective sample sizes were always at least a tenth of the number of iterations except on two of the tests around a temperature of 1 on the 24x24 and 32x32 experiments with $j=-1$. The aforementioned 24x24 experiment was run with 1000 NUTS iterations. The simulations were originally run and analyzed using Python3 and PyStan, though all code has been ported to R and RStan. The calculations were performed on an Intel Core i7 8th generation processor and the total computation time was on the order of 5 days.

We ran experiments on 4x4, 8x8, 16x16, 24x24, and 32x32 lattices. In plots N refers to the side length of the lattice; the lattices were NxN squares. Energy refers to the average energy per lattice site rather than total energy.

# Model Example

The data for the model holds the temperature and the size of the lattice. The sampling parameters are the spins on that lattice.

```{stan output.var="temp",eval=FALSE}
data {
  real<lower=0> temp;
  int<lower=1> dim_x;
  int<lower=1> dim_y;
}
parameters {
  unit_vector[2] spin[dim_x, dim_y];
}
```

The energy is calculated as a transformed parameter using the xy_energy function. It is then normalized by the number of elements to allow easier comparison of different lattices. We are sampling from a distribution representing a canonical ensemble at a specific temperature.

```{stan output.var="temp",eval=FALSE}
transformed parameters{
  real energy = xy_energy(spin);
  real energy_per_spin = energy / dim_x / dim_y;
}
model {
  temp ~ canonical_ensemble(energy);
}
```

```{r,cache=TRUE,include=FALSE}
model = stan_model('xy_model.stan')
```

We store the dimension of the lattice and the temperature in the input data and then sample the distribution.

```{r,cache=TRUE}
#basic parameters
chains <- 4
vorticity_samples <- 1000
iterations <- 10000
dim_x <- 4
dim_y <- 4
temp <- 2.

#initialize the data dictionary
data <- list(dim_x=dim_x, dim_y=dim_y, temp=temp)

#simulate the distribution
fit <- sampling(model,
      data=data,chains=chains,
      iter=iterations,
      verbose=FALSE,
      control = list(max_treedepth=15))
```

After sampling from the canonical distribution at a specific temperature, we calculate a few statistics. 

```{r}
print(summary(fit,pars="energy_per_spin")$summary)

energy = mean(extract(fit,pars='energy_per_spin')$energy_per_spin)
energy_var = var(extract(fit,pars='energy_per_spin')$energy_per_spin)
specific_heat = var(extract(fit,pars='energy')$energy) / dim_x / dim_y / temp / temp

spin_data <- extract(fit,pars="spin")$spin

vorticity <- mean(apply(spin_data[1:vorticity_samples,,,],1,vorticity_calc))
vortex_density <- vorticity / dim_x / dim_y
sprintf("Energy: %f Specific Heat: %f Vortex Density: %f",
        energy,specific_heat,vortex_density)
```

The specific heat is the amount of energy which must be added to the system to raise the temperature by 1 degree. The units of temperature are not actually a familiar scale to allow the Boltzmann constant $k$ to be 0; the specific units of temperature are not relevant for the vast majority of the analysis.

# Results

## KT Phase Transition and Vortices

![\label{fig:energy}Mean energy of a canonical ensemble of states of the XY Model at several temperatures](Images/plot_pos_energ.png){width=3.25in}

Recall that the KT transition refers to the spontaneous appearance of vortices as the temperature of the system increases. Like any phase transition, additional energy is required to change the properties of the system. The increased slope in the above figure corresponds the increased energy requirements. An additional feature is that once the lattice size reaches 8x8, the temperature-energy curve appears to have converged.

![\label{fig:heat}The specific heat of the XY models across temperatures and lattice sizes. The 24x24 lattice only has data points up to a temperature of 1.5.](Images/plot_pos_heat.png){width=3in}

Looking at the specific heat plot can make phase transition behaviours more obvious. The specific heat starts around $c=0.5$ at a temperature of 0. The peak specific heat occurs around a temperature of 1.1. At first and second order phase transitions the specific heat of the system approaches infinite as the system size grows. The XY model (and the KT transition) is a bit more finite and even the largest system sizes we tested converged.

![\label{fig:vort}The density of vortices at various temperatures. Below 0.8 it is almost exactly 0.](Images/plot_pos_vort.png){width=3in}

The vortex density of the XY model exhibits some similar characteristics to the magnetism of the Ising model. Both have a region where they are almost exactly 0 followed by a jump towards larger values. Unlike the Ising model, this transition in the XY model is smooth. At all system sizes we tested there is a soft shift between regions rather than a corner or a discontinuity.

![\label{fig:energy_vort}The relationship between energy per spin and vortices per spin for several lattice sizes.](Images/plot_pos_en_vort.png){width=3.25in}

After some cutoff, increasing the amount of energy leads to an almost linear increase in the number of vortices. Above energy densities of -1.5 per lattice point, 1 unit of energy density increase is equivalent to a vortex density increase of slightly over 0.1. Equivalently, adding a single vortex to the overal system requires slightly less than 10 units of energy.

## Reversed Interactions (J=-1)

![\label{fig:diff}The difference in mean energy between chains generated with J=1 and J=-1 at several temperatures and lattice sizes.](Images/plot_nega_diff.png){width=3.25in}

Many of our early experiments were run with $J=-1$. This may not have been intentional. However, we found that the energy curves of the XY Model with $J=1$ are identical to those with $J=-1$. The figure above shows the difference between the mean energy for chains on the same lattice at the same temperature for the two different values of $J$. As temperature increases the differences also increase, but the mean difference remains close to zero for all lattice sizes. Note that the scale in the above image is on the order of 0.01 energy units while the overall energy of the system is on the order of 1 units. It turns out that flipping half of the spins in a checker pattern by 180 degrees transforms directly between low energy states for $J=\{-1,1\}$.

# Conclusions

The XY Model has a wealth of interesting dynamics. The energy of the system after the KT transition is directly proportional to the number of vortices. An interaction strength (J) of -1 rather than 1 does not have a significantly different energy at any temperature. The lowest energy states with $J=-1$ are the highest energy states of $J=1$; there is a strong symmetry between the two extremes of energy. Stan's built in diagnostics helped to validate the resulting chains and gauge the accuracy of their estimates. While its lack of support for discrete parameters limits the models for which it is useful, there are still many contexts in which it is a viable option for simulating physical models.
