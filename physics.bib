@report{Imriska2009,
abstract = {A modified two-dimensional XY model, in which the energy of the nearest-neighbour interaction is a function with two minima has been considered. The extrema of Hamiltonian have been classified and transformations to a dual model and Coulomb gas have been performed. It has been shown that a large depth of an additional minimum of the interaction function can lead to the splitting of the phase transition into two. One of them (of the Ising type) is connected with appearance of solitons of an infinite length, and the second one with dissociation of pairs of vortices with half of the circulation quantum. A corresponding phase diagram is constructed. It is proposed that recursion relations of the Migdal-Kadanoff moving bonds approximation can be modified. This new version shows the presence of a line of true fixed points in the XY model, and can be applied for studying the modification of the XY model introduced in this paper. The modified XY model can be applied for describing the behaviour of superfluid 3 He thin films.},

These may follow any of three paths: (a) The excitation energy is lost without dissociation into radicals (by collision, or possibly radiation, as in aromatic hydrocarbons). (b) The molecules dissociate, but the resulting radicals recombine without escaping from the liquid cage. (c) The molecules dissociate and escape from the cage. In this case we would not expect them to move more than a few molecular diameters through the dense medium before being thermalized. In accordance with the notation introduced by Burton, Magee, and Samuel,22 the molecules following 22 Burton, Magee, and Samuel, J. Chern. Phys. 20, 760 (1952). THE JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS paths (a) and (b) can be designated H 2 0* and those following path (c) can be designated H 2 0t. It seems reasonable to assume for the purpose of these calculations that the ionized H 2 0 molecules will become the H 20 t molecules, but this is not likely to be a complete correspondence. In conclusion we would like to emphasize that the qualitative result of this section is not critically dependent on the exact values of the physical parameters used. However, this treatment is classical, and a correct treatment must be wave mechanical; therefore the result of this section cannot be taken as an a priori theoretical prediction. The success of the radical diffusion model given above lends some plausibility to the occurrence of electron capture as described by this crude calculation. Further work is clearly needed. A general method, suitable for fast computing machines, for investigatiflg such properties as equations of state for substances consisting of interacting individual molecules is described. The method consists of a modified Monte Carlo integration over configuration space. Results for the two-dimensional rigid-sphere system have been obtained on the Los Alamos MANIAC and are presented here. These results are compared to the free volume equation of state and to a four-term virial coefficient expansion.},

@techreport{Cross2008,
abstract = {The Ising Ferromagnet Consider a simple d-dimensional lattice of N classical "spins" that can point up or down, s i = ±1. We suppose there is an interaction J between nearest neighbor spins so that the parallel alignment is favored, with the Hamiltonian H = − 1 2 J i,$\delta$ s i s i+$\delta$ − µ i s i B. (1) Here the i sums run over all sites in the lattice, and the $\delta$ sum runs over the 2d nearest neighbors. The factor of 1/2 in the first term is to avoid double counting the interaction, and the second term is the interaction of the moments µs i with an external magnetic field B. The canonical partition function is Z = {\{}s i {\}} e −$\beta$ H {\{}s i {\}} (2) summing the Boltzmann factor over all spin configurations {\{}s i {\}}. The enumeration of all configurations cannot be done for d ≥ 3, and although possible in d = 2 is extremely hard there as well (a problem solved by Onsager). We will use an approximate solution technique known as mean field theory. Last term we solved the problem of noninteracting spins in a magnetic field described by the Hamiltonian H 0 = − i s i b, (3) writing b for µB. This is easy to deal with, since the Hamiltonian is the sum over independent spins, unlike Eq. (1) which also has pair interaction terms. For example we can calculate the partition function as the product of single spin partition functions Z 0 = [e −$\beta$b + e $\beta$b ] N (4) and the average spin on each site is s i = e $\beta$b − e −$\beta$b e $\beta$b + e −$\beta$b = tanh($\beta$b). (5) In the mean field approximation we suppose that the ith spin sees an effective field b e f f which is the sum of the external field and the interaction from the neighbors calculated as if each neighboring spin were fixed at its ensemble average value b e f f = b + J $\delta$ s i+$\delta$. (6) We now look for a self consistent solution where each s i takes on the same value s which is then given in analogy with Eq. (5) s = tanh[$\beta$(b + 2J ds)]. (7) Lets first look at b = 0. Define $\epsilon$ = 2d$\beta$ J s so that $\epsilon$ = 2d$\beta$ J tanh $\epsilon$. (8) This is easily solved graphically. For T {\textgreater} T c = 2d J/k B the only solution is $\epsilon$ = 0. For T {\textless} T c two new solutions develop (equal in magnitude but opposite signs) with |s| growing continuously below T c. Near T c we can get the behavior by expanding tanh $\epsilon$ in small $\epsilon$, so that Eq. (8) becomes $\epsilon$ = T c T ($\epsilon$ − 1 3 $\epsilon$ 3) (9) 1},
